# 2021 Portfolio

[codevh.com](https://codevh.com)

The reconstruction of my portfolio is now complete! 
Detailed within it are my specialties, experience, completed projects and more.

As for the theme, I incorporated one of my many interests: space. I like to think of it 
as a reminder that just like the solar system, my potential is limitless. 

Click the link above and take a moment to gaze at my latest masterpiece, 
and please share if you feel inclined. Additionally, if you're in the market to build a website, don't hesitate to send me a message!

I am actively seeking contract work and/or a full-time job opportunity, 
so if you or someone you know is looking to hire, send their contact information my way.
